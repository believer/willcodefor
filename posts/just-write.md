I've always found it easier to express myself through writing and these notes were started as a way of practicing that. I kept it up, at least fairly frequently, for three years. But, in the last year I've lacked inspiration, even though I've wanted to write.

## For me

The notes haven't felt "good enough", they needed to be <span style=" background: linear-gradient(to right, #f9a8d4, #be185d);-webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">perfect</span>. The absolute opposite of why I started this. It was supposed to be a bunch of random notes. Some more thought through, some fleeting thoughts that could be continuously improved upon (if I wanted to). The notes could even die.

This is supposed to be **for me**. If others find value in it, then great, but it's ultimately for my own benefit.

I love [stats](/stats), but it's part of the problem. Seeing the numbers go up or down makes me think too much about perfection. It makes me write for someone else.

## Connections

I want the notes to be [atomic](/notes#create-atomic-notes) and connected. The way I've structured them has worked against that. It's more like a traditional blog, ordered by creation date. I want to improve this.

## Consuming

I'm consuming a lot of content, but I don't use it. I watch something and forget most of it shortly thereafter. I want to be more intentional with my consumption. Actively think about the content.
